      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job can be multiple ones. I do not have a particular one in mind but it would need 
        to something I actually enjoy and as well as fit the lifestyle that I want.

      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Marietta, GA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It appeals to me. Being in front of a computer for hours on end is no issue for me. 
        The lifestlye is more suited for me I think, flexible hours I imagine. Also, having the 
        ability to creating something from nothing, a small idea can lead to something complete and proper.
